The application is a fingerprint enhancement system that uses super resolution model to improve the resolution of fingerprint image. The acquisition of latent fingerprints from criminal sites and other challenging environments poses a significant obstacle to forensic investigations and biometric identification systems. These latent fingerprints, often obtained under adverse conditions or from surfaces with low fingerprint residue, typically exhibit poor quality and low resolution, hampering accurate identification and matching processes. 
To Run the application:
python3 app.py
you can upload the fingerprint image on the webapp and download the better resolution picture.
